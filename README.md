3. To Create your first note, click on the '+' icon on the bottom right corner of the page.

4. A new note interface has opened and now you can enter a title and quickly give content to the note.

‚ö†Ô∏è Making a Note without a Title or Content is restricted to make sure that your Keeper doesn't get filled up with too much of useless notes.
